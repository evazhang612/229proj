Motivation: What problem are you tackling, and what's the setting you're considering?

Method: What machine learning techniques have you tried and why? (Linear Regression 2 baseline models) 
Preliminary experiments: Describe the experiments that you've run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you've done. You should have tried at least one baseline. (Error analysis MSE)

hopefully implemented by tomorrow evening.
Next steps: Given your preliminary results, what are the next steps that you're considering? (Sunday) 

Dev set: 
Ratio datasets 
industry returns: output value: -> starting with few features 
supervised learning: 
if they are good classification: adding more features into it
